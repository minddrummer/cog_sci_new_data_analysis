notes:
the SixThres_scale_modelB_bounded_fitting_result.mat and Parameter7_ModelB_ModelingResult_Bounded_191Subjects.mat are basically the same model: ModelB(6thres and scaling) modeling in the bounded process. the model results are 99% the same, with some random errors.
The point is that the Parameter7_ModelB_ModelingResult_Bounded_191Subjects.mat file contains the subject ID list, which is needed for the merging process.


the turns for reported and modeling are:
